MergeTree is a family of storage engines.

MergeTrees are different in two ways:
- they may be replicated and non-replicated;
- they may do different actions on merge: nothing; sign collapse; sum; apply aggregete functions.

So we have 14 combinations:
    MergeTree, CollapsingMergeTree, SummingMergeTree, AggregatingMergeTree, ReplacingMergeTree, GraphiteMergeTree, VersionedCollapsingMergeTree
    ReplicatedMergeTree, ReplicatedCollapsingMergeTree, ReplicatedSummingMergeTree, ReplicatedAggregatingMergeTree, ReplicatedReplacingMergeTree, ReplicatedGraphiteMergeTree, ReplicatedVersionedCollapsingMergeTree

In most of cases, you need MergeTree or ReplicatedMergeTree.

For replicated merge trees, you need to supply a path in ZooKeeper and a replica name as the first two parameters.
Path in ZooKeeper is like '/clickhouse/tables/01/' where /clickhouse/tables/ is a common prefix and 01 is a shard name.
Replica name is like 'mtstat01-1' - it may be the hostname or any suitable string identifying replica.
You may use macro substitutions for these parameters. It's like ReplicatedMergeTree('/clickhouse/tables/{shard}/', '{replica}'...
Look at the <macros> section in server configuration file.

For the Collapsing mode, the only parameter is the name of a sign column - a special column that is used to 'collapse' rows with the same primary key while merging.

For the Summing mode, the optional parameter is a list of columns to sum while merging. This list is passed in round brackets, like (PageViews, Cost).
If this parameter is omitted, the storage will sum all numeric columns except columns participating in the primary key.

For the Replacing mode, the optional parameter is the name of a 'version' column. While merging, for all rows with the same primary key, only one row is selected: the last row, if the version column was not specified, or the last row with the maximum version value, if specified.

For VersionedCollapsing mode, the 2 parameters are the name of a sign column and the name of a 'version' column. Version column must be in primary key. While merging, a pair of rows with the same primary key and different sign may collapse.

You can specify a partitioning expression in the PARTITION BY clause. It is optional but highly recommended.
A common partitioning expression is some function of the event date column e.g. PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(EventDate) will partition the table by month.
Rows with different partition expression values are never merged together. That allows manipulating partitions with ALTER commands.
Also it acts as a kind of index.

Sorting key is specified in the ORDER BY clause. It is mandatory for all MergeTree types.
It is like (CounterID, EventDate, intHash64(UserID)) - a list of column names or functional expressions
in round brackets.
If your sorting key has just one element, you may omit round brackets.

By default primary key is equal to the sorting key. You can specify a primary key that is a prefix of the
sorting key in the PRIMARY KEY clause.

Careful choice of the primary key is extremely important for processing short-time queries.

Optional sampling expression can be specified in the SAMPLE BY clause. It is used to implement the SAMPLE clause in a SELECT query for approximate query execution.
Sampling expression must be one of the elements of the primary key tuple. For example, if your primary key is (CounterID, EventDate, intHash64(UserID)), your sampling expression might be intHash64(UserID).

Engine settings can be specified in the SETTINGS clause. Full list is in the source code in the 'dbms/src/Storages/MergeTree/MergeTreeSettings.h' file.
E.g. you can specify the index (primary key) granularity with SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192.

Examples:

MergeTree PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(EventDate) ORDER BY (CounterID, EventDate) SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192

MergeTree PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(EventDate) ORDER BY (CounterID, EventDate, intHash32(UserID), EventTime) SAMPLE BY intHash32(UserID)

MergeTree PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(EventDate) ORDER BY (CounterID, EventDate, intHash32(UserID), EventTime) PRIMARY KEY (CounterID, EventDate) SAMPLE BY intHash32(UserID)

CollapsingMergeTree(Sign) PARTITION BY StartDate SAMPLE BY intHash32(UserID) ORDER BY (CounterID, StartDate, intHash32(UserID), VisitID)

SummingMergeTree PARTITION BY toMonday(EventDate) ORDER BY (OrderID, EventDate, BannerID, PhraseID, ContextType, RegionID, PageID, IsFlat, TypeID, ResourceNo)

SummingMergeTree((Shows, Clicks, Cost, CostCur, ShowsSumPosition, ClicksSumPosition, SessionNum, SessionLen, SessionCost, GoalsNum, SessionDepth)) PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(EventDate) ORDER BY (OrderID, EventDate, BannerID, PhraseID, ContextType, RegionID, PageID, IsFlat, TypeID, ResourceNo)

ReplicatedMergeTree('/clickhouse/tables/{layer}-{shard}/hits', '{replica}') PARTITION BY EventDate ORDER BY (CounterID, EventDate, intHash32(UserID), EventTime) SAMPLE BY intHash32(UserID)
